      </h2>

      <p>
        At GT Foundation, we believe that secure housing is the foundation of a
        better life. Our Housing Projects initiative is dedicated to
        constructing affordable, durable homes for vulnerable communities,
        ensuring families have a safe place to call home.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through strategic partnerships and community-driven projects, we aim to
        create sustainable housing solutions that not only provide shelter but
        also improve overall well-being. By investing in quality housing, we
        empower families, strengthen communities, and pave the way for a
        brighter, more secure future.
