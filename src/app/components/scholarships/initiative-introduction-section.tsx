      <p>
        At GT Foundation, we believe that education is the key to breaking the
        cycle of poverty and unlocking a brighter future. Our Scholarship
        Program is dedicated to providing financial aid and academic support to
        deserving students, ensuring they have the resources needed to excel in
        their studies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through merit-based and need-based scholarships, we support students
        from underprivileged backgrounds, helping them access quality education
        without financial burdens. Our program also includes mentorship, career
        guidance, and skill development opportunities to equip scholars for
        success beyond the classroom.
